# Retro Games Experiments

---

I tried my hand at two types of text-based "retro" games, mostly for exploring both some general concepts of coding and data structures, and for understanding some basic ideas of game design:

+ `rogue-level-generator`: A generator for _Rogue_ levels (surprise!) and simultaneously an experiment with network theory and PyGame
+ `text-adventure`: An interactive fiction engine (now, this was rather a euphemism for my code) and simultaneously an experiment with NLP and story-telling

Anyone interested in real, playable games: Please move on, there's nothing to see here.
